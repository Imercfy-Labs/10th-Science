"Define dispersion of light.","When a beam of white light or composite light is refracted through any transparent media such as glass or water, it is split into its component colours. This phenomenon is called as 'dispersion of light'."
"State Rayleigh's law of scattering.","Rayleigh's scattering law states that, 'The amount of scattering of light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of its wavelength'.

"Differentiate convex lens and concave lens.","Convex lens:
1. It is thicker at the middle than at the edges.
2. It is a converging lens.
3. It forms both real and virtual images.

Concave lens:
1. It is thinner at the middle than at the edges.
2. It is a diverging lens.
3. It forms only virtual images."
"What is the power of accommodation of the eye?","* The ability of the eye lens to focus nearby as well as the distant objects is called the power of accommodation of the eye.
* This is achieved by changing the focal length of the eye lens with the help of ciliary muscles."
"What are the causes of 'Myopia'?","1. The lengthening of eye ball.
2. The focal length of eye lens is reduced.
3. The distance between eye lens and retina increases.
4. The far point will not be at infinity.
5. The far point comes closer."
"Why does the sky appear blue in colour?","When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue colour (shorter wavelength) is scattered to a greater extent than the red colour (longer wavelength). This scattering causes the sky to appear blue in colour."
"Why are traffic signals red in colour?","* Red light has the highest wavelength.
* It is scattered by atmospheric particles.
* So red light is able to travel the longest distance through a fog, rain etc."
"List any five properties of light?","* Light is a form of energy.
* Light always travels along a straight line.
* Light does not need any medium for its propagation. It can even travel through a vacuum.
* The speed of light in vacuum or air is, c = 3 × 108 ms-1
* Since light is in the form of waves, it is characterized by a wavelength (λ) and a frequency (v), which are related by the following equation: c = vλ (c = velocity of light).
* Different coloured light has a different wavelength and frequency."
"Explain the rules for obtaining images formed by a convex lens with the help of ray diagram.","Rule-1: When a ray of light strikes the convex or concave lens obliquely at its optical centre, it continues to follow its path without any deviation.

Rule-2: When rays parallel to the principal axis strikes a convex or concave lens, the refracted rays are converged to (convex lens) or appear to diverge from (concave lens) the principal focus.

Rule-3: When a ray passing through (convex lens) or directed towards (concave lens) the principal focus strikes a convex or concave lens, the refracted ray will be parallel to the principal axis."
"Differentiate the eye defects: Myopia and Hypermetropia.","Myopia:
1. It is also known as near-sightedness.
2. The image is formed in front of the retina.
3. The far point comes closer.
4. It is corrected by using a concave lens.

Hypermetropia:
1. It is also known as far-sightedness.
2. The image is formed behind the retina.
3. The near point moves away.
4. It is corrected by using a convex lens."
"State laws of refraction.","First law of refraction: The incident ray, the refracted ray of light and the normal to the refracting surface all lie in the same plane.

Second law of refraction: The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence and sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of refractive indices of the two media. This law is also known as Snell's law.
sin i/sin r = µ2/µ1"
"Define refractive index of a medium.","The ratio of speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in a medium is defined as refractive index 'p' of that medium."
"What is meant by monochromatic source?","If a source of light produces a light of single colour, it is known as a monochromatic source."
"When white light is refracted by a transparent medium what will you get? Why?","1. When white light is refracted by a transparent medium, a spectrum is obtained.
2. This is because, different coloured lights are bent through different angles."
"What is scattering of light?","When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, the atoms and molecules of different gases present in the atmosphere refract the light in all possible directions. This is called as 'Scattering of light'."
"State the types of scattering.","1. Elastic scattering
2. Inelastic scattering"
"What is elastic scattering?","If the energy of the incident beam of light and the scattered beam of light are same, then it is called as 'elastic scattering'."
"What is inelastic scattering?","If the energy of the incident beam of light and the scattered beam of light are not same, then it is called as 'inelastic scattering'."
"How are different types of scattering formed? Mention the types of scattering.","The nature and size of the scatterer results in different types of scattering. They are

1. Rayleigh scattering
2. Mie scattering
3. Tyndall scattering
4. Raman scattering"
"What is Rayleigh scattering?","The scattering of sunlight by the atoms or molecules of the gases in the earth's atmosphere is known as Rayleigh scattering."
"Why the colour of the Sun is red at sunrise and sunset?","At sunrise and sunset, the light rays from the Sun have to travel a larger distance in the atmosphere than at noon. Hence, most of the blue lights are scattered away and only the red light which gets least scattered reaches us. Therefore, the colour of the Sun is red at sunrise and sunset."
"When does Mie scattering take place?","Mie scattering takes place when the diameter of the scatterer is similar to or larger than the wavelength of the incident light."
"What are the causes of Mie scattering?","Mie scattering is caused by pollen, dust, smoke, water droplets, and other particles in the lower portion of the atmosphere."
"Ramu passes white light through a quartz prism. For which colour refractive index is greater?","Refractive index is maximum for violet light when white light passes through a quartz prism."
"Sita has kept a stud consists of diamond. What will she observe? Give reason.","The diamond stud appears bright because of total internal reflection."
"Guna passes a ray light through a glass slab. Which optical phenomenon will take place? What can he observe with reference to wavelength?","When a ray of light enters a glass slab he can observe refraction of light. He observed that wavelength of light decreases."
"A prism is placed in the minimum deviation position. Chari has passed a ray of light at an angle of 45°, then what is the value of angle of emergence? Why?","The angle of emergence = 45°.
Since, in the minimum deviation positron, angle of incidence is equal to angle of emergence."
"Mani is using a lens of power 2 dioptre. What is the focal length of the lens?","Focal length = 1/power
F= 1/2 = 0.5 m"
"Surya has placed a lens of power 1 D in side water. What will happen to power of the lens?","The power of the lens will be more than original power."
"Sonu has observed some lines in solar spectrum are absorbed by the elements present in the atmosphere. What are the lines?","The lines are Fraunhofer lines."

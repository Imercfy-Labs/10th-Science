"Two resistors when connected in parallel give the resultant resistance of 2 ohms, but when connected in series the effective resistance becomes 9 ohms. Calculate the value of each resistance.","Resultant resistance of parallel combination RP = 2 Ω
Resultant resistance of series combination RS = 9 Ω
2(R1 + R2) = R1R2 ….. (1)
RS = R1 + R2
⇒ 9 = R1 + R2
⇒ R1 = 9 – R2 ….. (2)
Substitute equation (2) in equation (1)
2(9 – R2 + R2) = (9 – R2) R2
⇒ 18 = 9R2 - R2²
⇒ R2² - 9R2 + 18 = 0
⇒ (R2 – 3) (R2 – 6) = 0
⇒ R2 = 3, 6
(i) If R2 = 3; R1 = 9 – R2 = 9 – 3 = 6 Ω

When 'n' resistors of equal resistance R are connected in series, the equivalent resistance is 'nR'
RS = nR
⇒ RS = 5R
⇒ R = RS/5
⇒ R = 0.2 RS
Each part of resistance 'R' is equal to 0.2 times of original resistance.

(b) Effective Resistance of 5 Resistors
1/RP = 1/R + 1/R + 1/R + 1/R + 1/R = 5/R

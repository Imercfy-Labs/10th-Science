"What is meant by mechanics? How can it be classified?","Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the effect of force on bodies. It is divided into two branches namely statics and dynamics."
"What is statics?","Statics deals with the bodies, which are at rest under the action of forces."
"What is dynamics?","Dynamics is the study of moving bodies under the action of forces."
"What is Kinematics?","Kinematics deals with the motion of bodies without considering the cause of motion."
"What is Kinetics?","Kinetics deals with the motion of bodies considering the cause of motion."
"Define momentum. State its unit.","The product of mass and velocity of a moving body gives the magnitude of linear momentum. It acts in the direction of the velocity of the object.
Its S.I unit is kg ms-1."
"What is meant by a force?","Force is one that changes or tends to change the state of rest or of uniform motion of a body."
"State the effects of force.","1. Produces or tries to produce the motion of a static body.
2. Stops or tries to stop a moving body.
3. Changes or tries to change the direction of motion of a moving body."

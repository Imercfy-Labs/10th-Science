"Two bodies have a mass ratio of 3 : 4 The force applied on the bigger mass produces an acceleration of 12 ms2. What could be the acceleration of the other body, if the same force acts on it.","Ratio of masses m1 : m2 = 3 : 4
Acceleration of m2 is a2 = 12 m/s²
Force acting of m2 is F2 = m2a2
F2 = 4 × 12 = 48N

∴ Force acting on m1 is F1 = 48N

F1 × d1 = F2 × d2
= 140 × 40 = 40 × d2

"State Newton's laws of motion.","(i) Newton's First Law: States that 'every body continues to be in its state of rest or the state of uniform motion along a straight line unless it is acted upon by some external force'.

(ii) Newton's Second Law: States that 'the force acting on a body is directly proportional to the rate of change of linear momentum of the body and the change in momentum takes place in the direction of the force'.

(iii) Newton's third law: States that 'for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. They always act on two different bodies'.",Short Answer
"Deduce the equation of a force using Newton's second law of motion.","Let, 'm' be the mass of a moving body, moving along a straight line with an initial speed V. After a time interval of 't', the velocity of the body changes to v due to the impact of an unbalanced external force F.
Initial momentum of the body Pi = mu
Final momentum of the body Pf = mv
Change in momentum Δp = Pi – Pf – mv – mu
By Newton's second law of motion,
Force, F ∝ rate of change of momentum
F ∝ change in momentum / time
F ∝ (mv-mu)/t
F = km(v-u)/t
Here, k is the proportionality constant.
k = 1 in all systems of units. Hence,
F = m(v-u)/t
Since,
acceleration = change in velocity/time,
a = (v – u)/t.
Hence, we have F = m × a
Force = mass × acceleration",Derivation
"State and prove the law of conservation of linear momentum.","Law of conservation of linear momentum states that 'the total momentum of a system of bodies remains constant provided no external force acts on them'.

Proof:
Let two bodies A and B having masses m1 and m2 move with initial velocity u1 and u2 in a straight line. Let the velocity of the first body be higher than that of the second body, i.e,, u1 > u2. During an interval of time t second, they tend to have a collision. After the impact, both of them move along the same straight line with a velocity v1 and v2 respectively.
Force on body B due to A,
FB = m2(v2 – u2)/t
Force on body A due to B,
FA = m1(v1 – u1)/t
By Newton's III law of motion,
Action force = Reaction force
FA = -FB
m1(v1 – u1)/t = -m2 (v2 – u2)/t
m1 v1 + m2 v2 = m1 u1 + m2 u2
The above equation confirms in the absence of an external force, the algebraic sum of the momentum after collision is numerically equal to the algebraic sum of the momentum before collision.
Hence the law of conservation of linear momentum is proved.",Derivation
"Describe rocket propulsion.","1. Propulsion of rockets is based on the law of conservation of linear momentum as well as Newton's III law of motion.
2. Rockets are filled with fuel (either liquid or solid) in the propellant tank. When the rocket is fired, this fuel is burnt and hot gas is ejected with high speed from the nozzle of the rocket, producing a huge momentum.
3. To balance this momentum, an equal and opposite reaction force is produced in the combustion chamber, which makes the rocket project forward.
4. While in motion, the mass of the rocket gradually decreases, until the fuel is completely burnt out.
5. Since there is no net external force acting on it, the linear momentum of the system is conserved.
6. The mass of the rocket decreases with altitude, which results in the gradual increase in the velocity of the rocket.
7. At one stage, it reaches a velocity, which is sufficient to just escape from the gravitational pull of the Earth. This velocity is called escape velocity.",Short Answer
"State the universal law of gravitation and derive its mathematical expression.","Newton's universal law of gravitation states that every particle of matter in this universe attracts every other particle with a force. This force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the centres of these masses. The direction of the force acts along the line joining the masses.

Force between the masses is always attractive and it does not depend on the medium where they are placed.

Let, m1 and m2 be the masses of two bodies A and B placed r metre apart in space
Force
F ∝ m1 × m2
F ∝ 1/r²
On combining the above two expressions
F ∝ (m_1×m_2)/r^2
F = (Gm_1 m_2)/r^2
Where G is the universal gravitational constant. Its value in SI unit is 6.674 × 10-11 N m² kg-2.",Derivation

2. Helps in discovering new stars and planets.
3. One of the irregularities in the motion of stars is called 'Wobble' lead to the disturbance in the motion of a planet nearby. In this condition, the mass of the star can be calculated using the law of gravitation.
4. Helps to explain germination of roots is due to the property of geotropism, which is the property of a root responding to the gravity.
5. Helps to predict the path of the astronomical bodies.",Short Answer
"Two blocks of masses 8 kg and 2 kg respectively lie on a smooth horizontal surface in contact with one other. They are pushed by a horizontally applied force of 15 N. Calculate the force exerted on the 2 kg mass.","Mass of first block m1 = 8 kg
Mass of second block m2 = 2 kg
Total mass M = 8 + 2 = 10 kg
Force applied F = 15 N
∴ Acceleration a = F/M

"A heavy truck and bike are moving with the same kinetic energy. If the mass of the truck is four times that of the bike, then calculate the ratio of their momenta.","Let the mass of truck be m1
Let the mass of bike be m2
m1 = 4m2
∴ m_1/m_2 = 4
Kinetic energy K.E1 = K.E2
∴ m1v_1^2/2 = m2v_2^2/2
m1v_1^2 = m2v_2^2
4m2v_1^2 = m2v_2^2
v_1^2 = v_2^2/4
v_1 = v_2/2
Ratio of momenta be P1 : P2
= m1v1 : m2v2
= 4m2 × v_2/2 : m2v2
= 2m2v2 : m2v2
= 2 : 1
∴ Ratio of their momenta = 2 : 1",Numerical Problem
"'Wearing helmet and fastening the seat belt is highly recommended for safe journey' Justify your answer using Newton's laws of motion.","(i) According to Newton's Second Law, when you fall from a bike on the ground with a force equal to your mass and acceleration of the bike.
According to Newton's Third Law, an equal and opposite reacting force on the ground is exerted on your body. When you do not wear a helmet, this reacting force can cause fatal head injuries. So it is important to wear helmet for a safe journey.

(ii) Inertia in the reason that people in cars need to wear seat belts. A moving car has inertia, and so do the riders inside it. When the driver applies the brakes, an unbalanced force in applied to the car. Normally the bottom of the seat applies imbalanced force friction which slows the riders down as the car slows. If the driver stops the car suddenly, however, this force is not exerted over enough time to stop the motion of the riders. Instead, the riders continue moving forward with most of their original speed because of their inertia.",Short Answer

"Find the final temperature of a copper rod whose area of cross section changes from 10 m² to 11 m² due to heating. The copper rod is initially kept at 90 K. (Coefficient of superficial expansion is 0.0021 /K).","Change in area ΔA = 11 – 10 = 1 m²
Initial temperature T1 = 90 K
Let Final temperature be T2K
A0 = 10 m²
Coefficient of superficial expansion is
αA = 0.0021 / k
ΔA/A_0 = αAΔT
1/10 = 0.0021 ΔT
∴ ΔT = 0.0021 × 10
= 0.021
T2 – T1 = 0.021
T2 – 90 = 0.021
∴ Final temperature T2 = 90.021 K",Numerical Problem

"Derive the ideal gas equation.","The ideal gas equation is an equation, which relates all the properties of an ideal gas. An ideal gas obeys Boyle's law and Charles's law and Avogadro's law.
According to Boyle's law, PV = constant ………. (1)
According to Charles's law,
V/T = constant ……… (2)
According to Avogadro's law,
V/T = constant …….. (3)
After combining equations (1), (2) and (3), you equation. can get the following
V/nT = constant ……. (4)
The above relation is called the combined law of gases. If you consider a gas, which contains µ moles of the gas, the number of atoms contained will be equal to µ times the Avogadro number, N0.
i.e., n = µNA
Using equation (5), in equation (4) can be written as
PV/µN_{A}T = constant
The value of the constant in the above equation is taken to be KB, which is called as Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10^-23 JK^-1). Hence, we have the following equation:
PV/µN_{A}T = KB
PV = µNAKBT
µNAKB = R
which is termed as universal gas constant whose value is 8.31 J mol^-1 K^-1.
PV = RT
Ideal gas equation is also called as equation of state because it gives the relation between the state variables and it is used to describe the state of any gas.",Conceptual Question
"Explain the experiment of measuring the real and apparent expansion of a liquid with a neat diagram.","To start with, the liquid whose real and apparent expansion is to be determined is poured in a container up to a level. Mark this level as L1. Now, heat the container and the liquid using a burner. Initially, the container receives the thermal energy and it expands. As a result, the volume of the liquid appears to have reduced. Mark this reduced level of liquid as L2. On further heating, the thermal energy supplied to the liquid through the container results in the expansion of the liquid. Hence, the level of liquid rises to L3. Now, the difference between the levels L1 and L3 is called as apparent expansion, and the difference between the levels L2 and L3 is called real expansion. The real expansion is always more than that of apparent expansion.
Real expansion = L3 – L2
Apparent expansion = L3 – L1",Conceptual Question
"If you keep ice at 0°C and water at 0°C in either of your hands, in which hand you will feel more chillness?
